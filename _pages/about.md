I am a PhD candidate at the University of New Hampshire under the supervision of Dr. Bonnie Brown. Broadly, I am currently studying eastern oyster population genomics and their responses to stressors, such as disease. My work seeks to uncover new knowledge regarding population structure of eastern oysters in a well-mixed estuarine system (Great Bay Estuary, NH, USA). Additionally, I use theoretical modeling to estimate population trends based on current ecological knowledge. Finally, I utilize transcriptomics and epigenetics to study eastern oyster responses to stressors and how that varies across lineages.
